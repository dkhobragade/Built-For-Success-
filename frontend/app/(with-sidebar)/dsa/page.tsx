// ðŸ§¾ Notes
// This course is built with a problem-solving-first approach, guiding you through every pattern and logic with clarity.

// Many questions include in-depth explanations and solution codes with variations.

// For practice, weâ€™ve embedded direct links where available. If certain problems are unavailable on platforms like LeetCode due to copyright, weâ€™ll provide detailed in-site content or TUF+ free trial links where needed.

// No third-party distractions. Our focus is on delivering a consistent, high-quality experience directly through our platform.

// âœ¨ Note: You chose our platform because of the clarity, structure, and value we offer â€” not just for external practice links. Stay focused, stay consistent. Everything you need is right here.
